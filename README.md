# Attendance-System-Using-Python-and-OpenCV

Author : MD ASHER 


This code is to detect Faces and Record their attendance in a CSV file.This can be modified to work with, Static Images, Videos, Mobile/Laptop Cameras, RTSP streams of Security Camera/IoT Devices or Drones etc.

As default, you have to store the person frontal image with his name, this can be integrated with GUI that captures unknown face and ask you to name it something so it can store it with the name to recognize it later.

Just like Biometric Attendance, Face Attendance can be use in large Companies, Classrooms, Malls etc.

Although Biometric is more reliable, But Face Attendance can detect very large amount persons and note their attendance in a csv file, Database etc, which will save a lot of time. Just think how much time consuming for everyone (if the quantity of person trying to record their attendance is very large) to stay in a line and wait for their turn to put his finger on a biometric attendance device. The Face attendance can record the so many person at a time and store his attendance when he enter in the Classroom, Office etc.

You can see in the video below how Face Attendance can be very useful when dealing with large crowd:
